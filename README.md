# mountain-diamond
A third person runner game.

Atop a mountain in the French Alps, hidden under the snow and protected by vicious winds and bad visibility, thick walls, lasers and top-notch security, there is a safe. A top secret safe. And inside that safe lie many marvels. Mythical ancient treasures, lost historical artefacts and secrets best left uncovered, too dangerous for the world to see. But all pales in comparison to the undisputed king of shiny rocks - the mountain diamond. The stuff of dreams for all long-fingered crooks. Many did try. Many failed.
But she was different. Her name always murmured respectfully. Día Montiffe. Fresh off making the Louvre security system looking like a primary school experiment, the beautiful blonde set her sights on the ultimate prize. Full of confidence, she climed the walls, danced through the laser beams and bagged the elusive beast!
Grinning, she jumps on her escape vehicle. But oh, oh, the cold got to it. It won't start! The alarm did, though. Red lights and wailing sirens fill the air. Gurads' shouting joins almost instantaneously. Time to move, but how? Looking around in panic, madam Montiffe spots a sled oddly lying in the snow behind the trees. She springs for it like a cat and the chase begins...


Seemingly safe from the guards, Día relaxes a bit. But then the silence is cut by a deafening roar. A whole pack of yetis dash by, apparently unhappy with the diamond being taken. It looks like it's not over just yet...
